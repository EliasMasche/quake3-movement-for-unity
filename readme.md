# Notes:

## Coordinate System
Quake uses a right-handed coordinate system while Unity uses a left-handed one. So coordinate values (X,Y,Z) have been swapped to reflect this difference.

## World Scale
UPS (units per second) is measured in Unity units (meters) and not idTech units.

## Configuration
Default script values emulate Quake III Arena movement with CPM(A) physics.

## Demo Assets
Demo scene meshes were built with ProBuilder 4.4 so GameObjects will have missing script components unless ProBuilder package is installed in your project. But these missing components can be safely removed if you don't have ProBuilder installed.
