# Notes:

## Coordinate System
Quake uses a right-handed coordinate system while Unity uses a left-handed one. So coordinate values (X,Y,Z) have been swapped to reflect this difference.

## World Scale
UPS (units per second) is measured in Unity units (meters) and not idTech units.

## Configuration
Default script values emulate Quake III Arena movement with CPM(A) physics.

## Demo Assets
Demo scene meshes were built with ProBuilder 4.4 so this package must be installed in your project for demo scene to function.
